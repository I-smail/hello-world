# hello-world
My first repository.
My name is Ismail ElMoussi. I'm 19 years old. I'm very new to the programming world. It looks exciting but at the same time scary. So many languages to learn, ressources to use, and projects to work on. All of this is very exciting. I hope I'll be able to find my path in this immense jungle and come out of this journey as an established programmer.
